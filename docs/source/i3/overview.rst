i3 Overview
===========

So, you got Qubes OS on your system, up and running with Xfce, lots of menus and windows, the 'Q' menu in the corner.

Happy days right? Well yes, but no. See your workflow with various qubes will start to feel clunky especially when you have a lot of windows everywhere.

Don't get me wrong, I love Xfce as a desktop environment, it is so solid and stable with lots of amazing tools.
But one must rise up, away from desktop environments and onwards to window managers.

.. note::
   Window managers are awesome but not necessary, you can skip this whole section and only apply the rest of the documentation, but you should use i3 :)

In this section I will give you a step by step guide to getting i3 up and running, and the great thing is you will be starting in a much more straightforward point in time than I did.
Qubes OS with i3 has become quite stable and with this documentation you will get everything working with little to no issues.
