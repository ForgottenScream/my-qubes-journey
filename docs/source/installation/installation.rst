Installing Qubes OS
===================

This is the moment you have been waiting for. Finally you will boot up your laptop (which shouldn't have anything valuable i.e. you backed everything up) and press the relevant F key (F11, F10, F9 - depends on manufactorer).

At that point a menu will show up with the USB option with Qubes OS, click it and test the installation media then install.

The setup process is quite straightforward and there are many other guides that have covered this so set up the user, agree to erase your drive, locale, password and so on.

Let it install, it will take a while and it will be in two parts. After the restart you will boot in, unlock the drive with your decryption password then finish the installation. 

Remember, only select the Fedora and Whonix template and get the system qubes, have them as disposables and depending on your setup don't allow keyboard or mice to connect without intervention (if you are on pc then fine).
