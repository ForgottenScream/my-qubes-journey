Overview
========

Before we start looking into threat models and explaining some of the critical components of Qubes OS, I wanted to give an overview of the project, stigma around it and some clarifications.

Why use Qubes OS
----------------
If I had a {insert coin of choice} for every time I read reasons for and against using Qubes OS or Linux I wouldn't stress about making money.
And it is funny because you have the same type of people on both sides of the conversation for Windows/Mac -> Linux and Linux -> Qubes OS.

.. note::
   Qubes OS is not Linux. In some corners of the privacy/security world you will find that Linux may not be so `secure <https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html>`_ as you thought/were told.

So to put this matter to bed and not have to discuss any further, here is a (clearly not biased) list of reasons **to** use Qubes OS and to **not** use Qubes OS.

Why You Should Use Qubes OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Qubes uses Xen-based virtualization to create isolated qubes. In other words - secure when talking about computer architecture.
- It gives you the opportunity to organize your digital life since right now you probably use one or two devices for everything, in contrast to your physical life where you are able to isolate various aspects of your life.
