Architecture
============

Before any good project you have to plan. This includes researching about what you want to do and how, which majority of the time means watching videos of other people doing what you want to do.
This section will look at the Qubes OS Architecture and how we want to shape it to our threat model as well as our needs. I will try to be generic but this is based on personal experience so expect opinionated views and choices.
