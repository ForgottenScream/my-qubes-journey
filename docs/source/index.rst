My Qubes OS Journey Documentation
=================================

Welcome to My Qubes OS Journey Documentation. 
This is where I document everything regarding Qubes OS which I will use to teach others and myself if/when I forget something.

For the full background, see :doc:`intro`.
I recommend starting with :doc:`Architecture <architecture/index>` before trying to install, just so you get the context and understanding down first.
Or dive into it like I did and look after to fill in the gaps, up to you.
